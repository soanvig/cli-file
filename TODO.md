# TODO

- [ ] Calling command without parameter should show interactive selection of command (or optionally with --interactive flag?)
- [ ] Add CI with build and release
- [ ] Add support for longer than one-word argument default values
- [ ] Add support for more characters (e.g. *) in argument default values
- [ ] Add support for qutting process with Ctrl+C (or any similar)
- [ ] Change variable substitution sign from `$` to something else, to not collide with shell variable substitution

- [x] README documentation
- [x] Add support for selecting command file location
- [x] Add --version and --help commands
- [x] Add CI with tests
